# InfraTrack

InfraTrack is a crowd-sourced platform designed to improve the identification and resolution of urban infrastructure issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, and fallen utility poles.

## Problem
Urban infrastructure issues are typically identified through manual inspections and limited government patrols, making it difficult to detect and resolve problems in a timely manner—especially in non-prime or remote areas.

## Solution
InfraTrack enables citizens to report infrastructure issues using geo-tagged images and timestamps, while providing authorities with a centralized system to prioritize, track, and resolve reported problems efficiently.

## Project Status
Initial setup in progress
